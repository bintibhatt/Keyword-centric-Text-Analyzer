# Keyword Centric Text Analyzer

## Overview

The Keyword-centric Text Analyzer offers three distinct search options:

- Basic Search functionality in the Keyword-centric Text Analyzer identifies sentences that directly contain the exact form of specified keywords, without any lemmatization applied. This search method is effective for precise matches based on the literal appearance of keywords in the text.

- Root Word Search employs lemmatization to match sentences based on the root forms of the provided keywords. This approach allows for a more comprehensive search, capturing variations of the keywords and enhancing the scope of relevant results.

- Context Search leverages BERT embeddings, a state-of-the-art natural language processing technique. By assessing contextual similarity, this search option identifies sentences that contextually align with the input keywords, offering a nuanced and semantic understanding of the text. This method is particularly useful for uncovering sentences with similar meanings or themes.
